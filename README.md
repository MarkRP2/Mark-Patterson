 Fun fact about me is I'm from MI and lived in NY for 8 years. Now I'm back and open to moving again. I am always open to moving and making changes for the right opportunity.
 I'm always open to joining a project and building my portfolio. The goal for this year is to break into a Business analyst role after graduating from my Tripleten boot camp.
 My primary skills are Tableau, Excel, Power Book BI, and SQL.
